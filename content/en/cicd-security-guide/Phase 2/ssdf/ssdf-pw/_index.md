 Produce Well-Secured Software (PW) in the Build and Deploy CI/CD Steps
---


### Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)

Organizations should produce well-secured software with minimal security vulnerabilities in its releases.

<br>

**PW.1**

<strong>Design Software to Meet Security Requirements and Mitigate Security Risks: </strong> Identify and evaluate the security requirements for the software; determine what security risks the software is likely to face during operation and how the software’s design and architecture should mitigate those risks; and justify any cases where risk-based analysis indicates that security requirements should be relaxed or waived. Addressing security requirements and risks during software design (secure by design) is key for improving software security and also helps improve development efficiency.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PW.1 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Embedding security controls directly into the build process

- Validating that build outputs (binaries, containers, packages) are hardened and free from known design-level weaknesses

- Preserving traceability from design requirements to deployed artifacts

**PW.4**

<p><strong>Reuse Existing, Well-Secured Software When Feasible Instead of Duplicating Functionality :</strong> Lower the costs of software development, expedite software development, and decrease the likelihood of introducing additional security vulnerabilities into the software by reusing software modules and services that have already had their security posture checked. This is particularly important for software that implements security functionality, such as cryptographic modules and protocols.</p><br>
<p> Note: PW.3 moved to PW.4 </p>

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PW.4 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Baking secure defaults into application code, containers, and deployment manifests

- Removing insecure, legacy, or unnecessary features from build artifacts

- Automatically applying baseline security settings during deployment

- Enforcing hardening standards before release

**PW.5**

<strong>Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices:</strong> Decrease the number of security vulnerabilities in the software, and reduce costs by minimizing vulnerabilities introduced during source code creation that meet or exceed organization-defined vulnerability severity criteria.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PW.5 in a build and deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Software artifacts are stored in secure, controlled repositories.

- Only approved, verified builds get stored and deployed.

- Repository access is restricted and auditable.

- Provenance and integrity checks are enforced before artifacts are accepted or deployed.
