<strong>CI/CD Cybersecurity SIG from The Continuous Delivery Foundation</strong>

This CI/CD Cybersecurity Guide was put together by the Continuous Delivery Foundation’s CI/CD Cybersecurity SIG, which plays a pivotal role in advancing CI/CD security and supporting organizations in meeting modern cybersecurity demands. The group focuses its efforts on integration frameworks, best practices, and emerging tooling, to address the critical need to embed security into every stage of the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring a resilient and secure software development lifecycle.
