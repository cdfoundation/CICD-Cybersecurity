## 1.0 Achieving Code and Prebuild Tasks of the Secure Software Development Framework

This chapter focuses specifically on DevSecOps tooling and practices related to Code and Prebuild actions of the CI/CD pipeline to achieve tasks defined by the Secure Software Development Framework. 

The [Secure Software Development Framework](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-218.pdf), developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring security across the software development process, from initial design through deployment and maintenance. The framework outlines key practices and guidelines that organizations can implement to secure their software development lifecycle (SDLC), with a particular emphasis on integrating security into automated processes.

| 1.1 Prepare the Organization (PO)      | Organizations should ensure that their people, processes, and technology are prepared to perform secure software development at the organization level. Many organizations will find some PO practices to also be applicable to subsets of their software development, like individual development groups or projects. |
| 1.2 Protect the Software (PS)          | Organizations should protect all components of their software from tampering and unauthorized access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1.3 Produce Well-Secured Software (PW) | Organizations should produce well-secured software with minimal security vulnerabilities in its releases.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1.4 Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)    | Organizations should identify residual vulnerabilities in their software releases and respond appropriately to address those vulnerabilities and prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.
